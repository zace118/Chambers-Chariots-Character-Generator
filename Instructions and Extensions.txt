Must generate a character sheet with race, class, and ability rolls.
Must be full stack(FE, BE, and DB)

Ideas for extension:
Allow/randomly assign spell choices
Full selection of character traits based upon level
Automatic assignment of stat rolls based on the class
Full customization of the character and multiclassing
Encounter generator (Same thing but with monsters: amount, type, and level of monsters)

That's it! Build out what you think would be awesome

CREATE DATABASE created_characters (
	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	race VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	class VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	level INT,
	hp INT,
	-- Idk what else to put...ability scores, by type??
